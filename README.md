# Polynomial Affine Gravity Projects

The Polynomial Affine Gravity is an alternative gravitational model whose fundamental field 
is the affine connection, instead of the metric tensor. This idea mimics the standarnd model
in particle physics, where the gravitational interaction is mediated by a gauge field. In this 
repository I am keeping all the projects related to this affine model gravity
